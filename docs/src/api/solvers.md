# Dynamical System Variants

[baideep2019](@cite) introduced Discrete Deep Equilibrium Models which drives a Discrete Dynamical System to its steady-state. [pal2022mixing](@cite) extends this framework to Continuous Dynamical Systems which converge to the steady-stable in a more stable fashion. For a detailed discussion refer to [pal2022mixing](@cite).
