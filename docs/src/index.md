# DeepEquilibriumNetworks: (Fast) Deep Equlibrium Networks

DeepEquilibriumNetworks.jl is a framework built on top of [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/) and [Lux.jl](https://lux.csail.mit.edu/dev/) enabling the efficient training and inference for Deep Equilibrium Networks (Infinitely Deep Neural Networks).

## Installation

```julia
] add DeepEquilibriumNetworks
```
