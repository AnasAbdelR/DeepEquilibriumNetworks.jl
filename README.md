# FastDEQ

## Implemented Models

* DeepEquilibriumNetwork
* SkipDeepEquilibriumNetwork

## Non-Linear Solvers (GPU Compatible)

To be ported to NonLinearSolve.jl

* Broyden

## Linear Solvers (GPU Compatible)

To be ported to LinearSolve.jl

## Next Steps

- [ ] Rework the DEQ Backwards Pass since it uses a lot of memory (explicitly stores the Jacobian)
